#Notes App

Notes App is a Javascript app that interacts with the index.html page

There is a package.json file, but you don't need it to use the basic local storage set up in the app.

Just open the index.html page in your browser and start adding notes.

If you want to use mongoDB for a database and get a server running to connect to it, the foundation is there. Just run the command ```npm install``` in the folder where you put the app and you can go from there.
